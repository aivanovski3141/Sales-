# Sales Helper Agent

This repository contains a Python-based sales outreach generator.

## Purpose

- Take pasted LinkedIn profile text and company website text as input
- Generate:
  - LinkedIn outreach message
  - Email outreach message
  - Short follow-up message
  - 15–20 second call opener

## Guidelines

- Use Australian spelling
- Tone: professional, direct, no hype
- No buzzwords
- No scraping or automation of LinkedIn
- Output saved as Markdown files

## Target Audience

- Australian companies with 100–1000 employees
- Personas: CIO, CTO, Head of Data, IT Manager

## Ideal Customer Sweet Spot

- 100–1000 employee organisations
- Internal IT or data team already exists
- Signals such as:
  - Cloud migration or modernisation
  - Multiple systems or data silos
  - Data platform, analytics, or AI initiatives
  - Cost, reliability, or security concerns
- If no clear fit is present, messaging should be exploratory rather than sales-led

## Information Sources

- Company website text is the primary source for business context (https://www.idea11.com.au)
- LinkedIn profile text is the primary source for role, responsibilities, and priorities
- Outreach must reference at least one concrete detail from either source
